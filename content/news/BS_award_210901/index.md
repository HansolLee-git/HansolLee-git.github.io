## Winning the Outstanding Achievement Award at KAIST
I am happy to share a significant milestone from my undergraduate years: receiving the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST.

This award is presented to undergraduate students who have demonstrated consistent academic excellence throughout the semester. Looking back at the rigor of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at KAIST, receiving this recognition was a deeply meaningful moment for me.

## Acknowledgments
I am grateful to the professors at KAIST who challenged me to think critically and to my friends who made the intense study sessions much more enjoyable.
