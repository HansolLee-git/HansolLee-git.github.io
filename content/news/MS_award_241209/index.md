## Winning the Outstanding Master's Research Award at KAIST

I am deeply honored to announce that I have received the Outstanding Master's Research Award from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST in December, 2024.

This award is presented to the top three graduates in the department who have demonstrated exceptional academic performance and impactful research outcomes throughout their Master’s program. Looking back at the countless hours spent in the lab and the library, receiving this recognition is a deeply rewarding moment for me. 

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my Master's advisor, my lab mates at KAIST. I look forward to carrying this momentum into my future projects and research.
