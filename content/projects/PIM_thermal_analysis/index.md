## Reduced-order thermal modeling of 2.5D/3D PIM heterogeneous package

Collaborating with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) – a research
institution specializing in semiconductor technologies in South Korea— our team developed
PIM heterogeneous packages integrating high-bandwidth memory and neural processing units on
an interposer that allows signal and power routing. By analyzing the package’s configuration and
electrical interconnections, I developed a reduced-order thermal model that accurately predicts internal
temperatures. 

The reduced-order thermal model consists of a thermal resistance network which can be programmed using MATLAB. The prediction of the model is validated with Ansys Fluent and Icepak, a commercial CFD software package. The model’s predictions highlighted that existing thermal management solutions are
insufficient for cooling the excessive heat dissipation from advanced electronic devices. Furthermore,
our work taught me the importance of coupling electrical characteristics with thermal analysis to verify
the thermal reliability of electronics.
