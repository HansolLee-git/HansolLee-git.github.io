## Analytical thermal-hydraulic modeling of silicon-embedded manifold microchannel (MMC) heat sinks

Electronics are now facing thermal bottlenecks which limit their performance due to the physical limiation of cooling its heat generation. Introduction of 3D heterongenous integration of ICs and development of the next-generation power semiconductors both have led to the necessitiy of effective and energy-efficient cooling schemes which are capable of manage very high-heat flux over 1 kW/cm $^{2}$. 

A manifold microchannel (MMC) heat sink is a promising cooling solution as it has a very low pressure drop and a uniform temperature distribuiton compared to conventional heat sinks. The superior performance of MMC comes from the fluid distributing manifold on top of the microchannels. However, previous models for predicing the thermal performance of MMCs have not taken into account the effects of flow distribution on its thermal performance. 

To estimate its thermal performance and flow non-uniformity,
I developed an analytical thermal-hydraulic model of an embedded MMC heat sink, consisting of easily
solvable 1D ordinary differential equations. This model enabled accurate and efficient predictions of
thermal-hydraulic performance across various geometries, reducing computation time from several
days (with conventional 3D CFD simulations) to just seconds.
