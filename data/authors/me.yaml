    summary: "Conducted multi-fideilty performance optimization of silicon-embedded manifold microchannels (MMC) for thermal management of advanced electronics. Includes theoretical modeling and thermal-fluidic experiment works. We achieved record-high heat dissipation performance (> 2kW/cm2) within the device pressure drop of 10 kPa. Worked with Professor Ikjin Lee's Innovative Design Optimization Lab at KAIST.\n"
