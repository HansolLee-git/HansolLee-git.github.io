      text: |-
        My mission is to pioneer electro-thermal co-design strategies of advanced packaging by combining my background in heat transfer with signal/power integrity and IC design. 
        
        Current focus areas are as follows.
        * Thermal Management of 3D ICs: Developing advanced cooling solutions and thermal modeling techniques in vertically stacked chips.
        * Signal & Power Integrity (SI/PI): Investigating how thermal effects on high-speed signal transmission and power delivery.
        * Advanced Packaging: Exploring heterogeneous integration and new materials to improve the reliability of next-gen semiconductor interconnects.

        I'm very open to collaborate. Feel free to reach out! 😃
